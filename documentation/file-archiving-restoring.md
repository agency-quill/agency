# Archiving and restoring files
We have a limited amount of server space wth which to work, so we need to periodically archive our files.

## Archiving
When we are bumping up against our data limit, we archive folders in the `Email` and `WebAd` folders. This is handled by [Ben Wilson](mailto:Ben.Wilson@quill.com) and [Zibi Szczalba](mailto:Zibi.Szczalba@quill.com).

We usually only archive entire months or years at a time. You will know a file has been archived because it's parent folder will contain the word "archived".

Sometimes archiving web and email working files doesn't remove enough and we look for other folders (i.e. `Personal_Projects`) to archive.

## Restoring
If you need access to an archived file, you can request for it to be restored. Restored files are found in the `__UNARCHIVED_Folder` folder in the root of the `Email` and `WebAd` folders. 
 
### The Process
* Check the `__UNARCHIVED_Folder` folder root, and in the `__REARCHIVE_Folder` folder to make sure it has not already been restored
* If the folder hasn't been restored, send an email to [Ben &amp; Zibi](mailto:Ben.Wilson@quill.com,Zibi.Szczalba@quill.com) asking them to restore the assets you need by job number.
* The restored folder will be placed in the root of the `__UNARCHIVED_Folder` folder (e.g. `__UNARCHIVED_Folder/W14_05_374_HELP`)
* Make any updates to the files in the `__UNARCHIVED_Folder`
* If the file in question is repeatedly updated leave it in the `__UNARCHIVED_Folder` folder for future updates
* If not, re-archive the files. The `__REARCHIVE_Folder` folder is in the root of the `__UNARCHIVED_Folder` folder. To re-archive the files, move the folder from the `__UNARCHIVED_Folder` folder to the proper folder within the `__REARCHIVE_Folder` folder (e.g. `__UNARCHIVED_Folder/__REARCHIVE_Folder/2014/05/W14_05_374_HELP`)
