# Archiving and restoring files
We have a limited amount of server space so we need to periodically archive our files.

## Archiving
When we are bumping up against our data limit, we archive folders in the `Email` and `WebAd` folders. We archive entire months or entire years. You will know a file has been archived because the folder has the word "archived" added to it. Sometimes archiving working files doesn't remove enough and we look for other folders (i.e. `Personal_Projects`) to archive.

## Restoring
If you need access to an archived file, you can request for it to be restored. Restored files are found in the `__UNARCHIVED_Folder` folder in the root of the `Email` and `WebAd` folders. 
 
The file restoration/re-archiving process is:

* Check the `__UNARCHIVED_Folder` to make sure it has not already been restored
* If not, send an email to Ben &amp; Zibi asking them to restore the email or web assets you need. Be sure to send the email or web request number of job you need restored.
* The restored folder will be placed in the root of the `__UNARCHIVED_Folder` folder (e.g. `__UNARCHIVED_Folder/W14_05_374_HELP`)
* Make any updates to the files in the `__UNARCHIVED_Folder`
* If the file in question is repeatedly updated leave it in the `__UNARCHIVED_Folder` folder
* If not, re-archive the files. The `__REARCHIVE_Folder` folder is in the root of the `__UNARCHIVED_Folder` folder. To re-archive the files, move the folder from the `__UNARCHIVED_Folder` folder to the proper folder within the `__REARCHIVE_Folder` folder (e.g. `__UNARCHIVED_Folder/__REARCHIVE_Folder/2014/05/W14_05_374_HELP`)
