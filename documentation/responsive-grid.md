# Responsive grid
>"Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user's behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation." – [Responsive Web Design – What It Is And How To Use It](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/01/guidelines-for-responsive-web-design/)

Most credit Ethan Marcotte with introducing the concept of responsive design in his 2010 _A List Apart_ article [Responsive Web Design.](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design) Conceptually it's pretty simple—use `CSS` to render `HTML` in differently depending on the user's device and behavior. In practice it is a little more complex.

One of the building blocks of a reponsive design is a __responsive grid__. A responsive grid uses a combination of cropping, scaling and wrapping to render a single block of `HTML` in the best possible presentation across multiple devices. This eliminates the need for different blocks of `HTML` for mobile, tablet and desktop implementations.

If you want to dig deeper on the topic there are a lot of resources out there. Google has a pretty good introduction: [Responsive Web Design Basics.](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive/)

## The underlying functionality
New elements, units, properties and functions made to `HTML5` and `CSS3` have made a responsive grid possible. Below are a few of the more important concepts and links for further research.

### Semantic HTML
`HTML5` added new elements in order to accommodate a new semantic philosphy. Generic `div` elements have been replaced with new, descriptive, elements like `header`, `section` and `footer` for page layout. The new elements describe the role of the content they contain. The `div` element still exists, but is used for non-semantic content divisions. You can find out more in the [Mozilla Developers Network (MDN) HTML elements reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).

### Media queries
`CSS3` has added some new typography units. Along with the `px`, `em` and `%` units we now have the `vh` and `vw` units.



### Responsive typography


### The `picture` element


### The `calc()` function


## The design


### Classes
