# Responsive grid
>"Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user's behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation."

Most credit Ethan Marcotte with introducing the concept of responsive design in his 2010 _A List Apart_ article [Responsive Web Design.](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design) Conceptually it's pretty simple—use `CSS` to render `HTML` differently depending on the user's device and behavior. In practice it is a little more complex.

The foundation of reponsive design is the __responsive grid__. Using a combination of cropping, scaling and wrapping, a responsive grid renders a single block of `HTML` in the best possible presentation across multiple devices.

## The underlying functionality
New elements, units, properties and functions made to `HTML5` and `CSS3` have made a responsive grid possible. Below are a few of the more important concepts.

### Semantic HTML
`HTML` has always had semantic elements, or elements whose name describes the content within them (i.e. the `<blockquote>`, `<h1>`, `<p>` and `<table>` elements). Originally it also had a bunch of elements that were intended for presentation purposes (i.e. the `<b>`, `<center>`, `<font>` and `<i>` elements).  It also had a couple of elements for layout (i.e. the `<div>` and `<span>` elements).

Once `CSS` came around all of the presentation elements were no longer needed, so they have, for the most part been deprecated.

`HTML5` added new elements in order to apply the semantic concept to layout. Generic `div` elements have been replaced with new, descriptive, elements like `header`, `section` and `footer`. The new elements describe the role of the content they contain. The `div` element still exists, but is used for non-semantic content divisions.

You can find out more about the new elements and which old elements have been deprecated in the [Mozilla Developers Network (MDN) HTML elements reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).

### Responsive typography
`CSS3` has added some new typography units to support responsive design. Along with the `px`, `em` and `%` units we now have the `vh`, `vw`, `vmin` and `vmax` units. The units are defined as:

+ `vh` Equal to 1% of the height of the viewport
+ `vw` Equal to 1% of the width of the viewport
+ `vmin` Equal to the smaller of vw and vh
+ `vmax` Equal to the larger of vw and vh

__Example:__
```css
font-size: 3.5vw;```

These allow us to set elemnt sizes relative to the dimensions of the viewport. This is particularly handy for font sizes since the `%` unit for `font-size` is relative to the `font-size` of the parent, not the parent's width or height.

### The `calc()` function
