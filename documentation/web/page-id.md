# Page ID
_Last updated 2/26/19_

To build a new supercategory or spotlight (ADCore/CMS-driven) page you will need a new URL (e.g. quill.com/3M-Post-It-Notes/cbx/391.html). To do that you will need to accomplish two tasks.

First, SDS creates a Page ID (a unique 3-digit number) and places the new page into the CMS navigation (e.g. quill.com/3M-Post-It-Notes/cbx/__391__.html).

Second, the SEO team creates the SEO-friendly part of the URL (e.g. quill.com/__3M-Post-It-Notes__/cbx/391.html).

## Requesting a Page ID through ServiceNow
* Open [ServiceNow](https://staples.service-now.com/).
* Use you Staples employee number and hub password.
* Select _Self Service_ from left-hand side bar.
* Select _Service Request_ in the right-hand column.
* Select _More..._ under _Quill Requests_ on the right-hand side of the screen.
* Select _Service Desk Only (Quill)_ from the _All Quill Requests_ list.
* In the _Notes / Comments_ field request a new Page ID providing the name of the page and where in the CMS Web dropdown menu the new page should go. (i.e. Web > Brand Stores).
* Include the text: _Please forward to App Supt (CMS/ADCore - US.Quill)_ in the _Notes / Comments_ field.
* Press either the _Order Now_ or _Add to Cart_ button (they are the same as far as I can tell).
* Click _Submit Order_.

The system will issue a receipt email and forward your request to your supervisor for approval. Once approved, you will get another email and the request will move to SDS to be resolved. That can mean being put in the list for the next release, put at the end of the backlog or being resolved ASAP.

If you donâ€™t hear from SDS after some time, send a follow-up email to the help desk, [USQC IT Web Support](USQCITWebSupport@Staples.com), including the request number of the ticket. Also include the Agency development team: [Nick Iozzo](mailto:nick.iozzo@quill.com), [Seyi Owolabi](mailto:seyi.owolabi@quill.com) and [Andrew Edmonds](mailto:andrew.edmonds@quill.com) plus your supervisor on the email.

You can always reach out the Agency development team for assistance or to submit the request.
