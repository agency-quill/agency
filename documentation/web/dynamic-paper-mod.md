# Dynamic Paper Module `html`
_Last updated 7/10/19_

To improve turn-around times and eliminate the need to update paper module images whenever there is a price change on the [Hot Deals](https://www.quill.com/daily-deals/cbx/35.html) page, SDS and the Agency have developed some new scripts, styles and `html` code. The code allows Product Specialists to update paper prices on the fly without requesting any updates to offer codes or images. It does this by pulling item prices from the back-end dynamically.

The new code is designed to work with the existing `2018-half-mod` web ad module. The new code is populated into the `u_ad_html_text` field.

Below is everything you need to use the dynamic paper module including: product images, flags, the `GetSkuPrice()` script, and more.

If you want to jump right into the code, there is an example at the end of this document.

__Reminder: Apostrophes/single quotes in the `u_ad_html_text` field need to be preceded by a backslash (e.g. `\'`). Also, positioning using `px` can pose an issue for responsive design.__

## Product Image
The module includes a product image. This should be a merchbase image, saved at 480px wide by 290px tall. Keep in mind that the bottom 10px of the image will be cut off. Save the file in the `.png` format, with a transparent background.

## Flags
Not all offers have a flag. At this point we support two: 'Hot Buy' and 'Sale.' This list may grow with the needs of the business.

The flag is html-based and is part of the `html` in the `u_ad_html_text` field.

### Hot Buy
![alt text](https://www.quill.com/content/iw/images/documentation/hot-buy.png "Hot Buy flag screen shot")

This flag is used when the offer is being presented to an inactive customer (i.e. a customer that hasn't made a paper purchase in 4 months or more).

##### Example
```html
<div class="flag--hotbuy">Hot Buy</div>
```

### Sale
![alt text](https://www.quill.com/content/iw/images/documentation/sale.png "Sale flag screen shot")

This flag is used when the offer is being presented to an active customer (i.e. a customer that has made a paper purchase within the last 3 months).

##### Example
```html
<div class="flag--sale">Sale</div>
```

## Dynamic Price Code
The code that makes these offers work is the `GetSkuPrice()` function written by SDS. Placing it in your code will dynamically insert the price of any item on the site in raw text form. To use it, send the function an array of two values: effort number and item, or find, number. The example below will pull the price for a case of [Quill Brand Copy Paper](https://www.quill.com/quill-brand-copy-paper-8-1-2-x-11-92-bright-20-lb-10-reams-500-sheets-720222/cbs/200885.html?Effort_Code=499&Find_Number=720222CT) (item 720222CT) for effort 499 (this effort may be expired at this time). This script is server-based and runs before the page loads. _The space after `<$=` and before `$>` are necessary for the script to function._

##### Example
```javascript
<$= GetSkuPrice(['499','720222CT']) $>
```

## Dynamic Savings Code
Some of the offers require both a regular price and a sale price. In these cases an Agency-developed script dynamically renders the amount of savings (the regular price minus the sale price). This script is browser-based and runs when the module is rendering, after the page has loaded.

The script does the following:
1. Grabs the price in the `span` element with the `wasPrice` class attribute
2. Gets the price in the `span` element with the `isPrice` class attribute
3. Subtracts the `isPrice` from the `wasPrice`
4. Puts the answer in the `span` element with the `salePrice` class attribute, replacing the `{{savings}}` text

The `wasPrice` should be set to effort 901 unless otherwise directed.

The example below shows the `html` that will render the sale price for a case of Quill Brand Copy Paper (effort: 499 / item: 720222CT), the regular price (effort: 901) and the amount of savings.

##### Example
```html
<p class="p--paper">Was <span class="strike">$<span class="wasPrice"><$= GetSkuPrice(['901','720222CT']) $></span></span> Save $<span class="savePrice">{{savings}}</span></p>

<h3 class="h3--paper quillRed"><span class="sup">$</span><span class="isPrice"><$= GetSkuPrice(['499','720222CT']) $></span></h3>
```

## Classes
There are a few new classes that have been added to the `agency5.css` style sheet to handle these modules.

__`div__background--paper`__ is the wrapper that contains all of the other content. It sets the background color and padding for the module.

__`div__content--paper`__ houses all of the main content. It holds the flag, product name, pricing info, limits, call to action button and usage / expiry / disclaimer text. It is left-aligned and has a width between 14% and 46% depending on viewport width.

__`div__img--paper`__ houses the product image. It is right-aligned and has a width between 53% and 85% depending on viewport width.

__`div__info--paper`__ is the floating paper info box. It houses the `p` element with the number of reams, brightness and paper weight info. It sets the background color, positioning (40% from the left) and padding for the box.

__`h2--paper`__ sets the font attributes for the product name.

__`h3--paper`__ sets the font attributes for the sale price.

__`img--paper`__ sets the position and width (from 67.875% to 94%, depending on viewport width) of the product image within the `div` element with the `div__img--paper` class.

__`p--paper`__ sets the font attributes for the pricing info, limits and info box.

## E-mail Jump Link `id`
One last note before getting to the code: Some emails and web ads use jump links to scroll to the paper ads on page load. In order to do this, there needs to be an `id` attribute assigned to one of the two paper ads in the first row of paper ads (module positions 18 and 19 of the `2019-hot-deals-2` ADCore template). The `id` that needs to be used is: 'paper'. It should be populated in the `u_ad_id` field of the offer code.
 
## The Code
Below is the code populated in the `u_ad_html_text` field of the `2018-half-mod` offer code `W19_06_040_4PLSP0550` following a screen shot of the ad it renders.
