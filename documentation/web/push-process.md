## File Size Thresholds
If you push a file to production larger that the threshold set by the system an email with the subject line __Big File[s] pushed from WEB_AD_Push queues__ is sent to the team. The email will have a list of all the files that surpass their threshold. Below is a table of the current files size thresholds.
