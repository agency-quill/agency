# Flag Push Process
_Last updated 12/10/19_

Flags are pushed to one folder with a specific name. We overwrite these flags on a regular basis and its important to not push a flag too early. 

__Important: The AE’s will let you know when the flags should be pushed.__

Flags should be 100x25px gifs. Text should be high contrast, and almost always white. 

## Step 1: 

Connect to the push server: `//contentsrvr/imagepush`

Navigate to the following: `//contentsrvr/imagepush/New_Content/PROD_WEB_QUILL/00_IMMEDIATE/iw/images/flags` 

_Note: You may need to do a delayed deployment for this. If so, push to the appropriate day._

## Step 2: 

Because we are overwriting existing flags, it’s important to use the correct file names.  

Rename the .gif file to the appropriate name below.

| Price Level | File Name  	   |
| :---------: | :------------: |
| 44 		  | event1.gif 	   | 
| 45 		  |	event2.gif     |
| 316 		  |	pennyDeals.gif | 
| 317 		  |	dollarDays.gif |
| 318 		  |	1daySale.gif   |
| 319 		  |	2daySale.gif   |

## Step 3: 
Push the updated file name to the `/iw/images/flags/` folder.
