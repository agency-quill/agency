# Anatomy of a URL
_Last updated 8/10/20_

In order to improve our ranking with Google, improve tracking information and readability, we need to make sure that we aren't including unnecessary URL parameters in our links. 




Below are examples of different URL types that we use on Quill.com and what should and shouldn't be included in URLs. If there are any missing please let me know and I will follow up with guidelines. Please share this with anyone I may have missed.
 
When providing URLs for web ads, email or landing pages please follow the below guidelines.  When populating a mock up, ADCore or custom HTML only the bold red text in the examples below should be used.  The rest should NOT be included.

Search Results
/search?keywords=note+pad&x=0&y=0&ajx=1
 
As a rule of thumb the following parameters should NOT be included in URLs: ajx, cm_sp, find_number, lcb, position_id, web_track_id, promo_code, x and y.  The following parameters SHOULD be included: buyer, effort_code (unless it is 901), keywords (for search results), loggedin and SkusetID (for NBSS).

Let me know if you have any questions.
