# How to request assistance from SDS

## If the issue is time-sensitive, create an incident ticket:
* Email [USQC ___IT___ (Quill) Problem Tickets](USQCITQuillProblemTickets@quill.com).
* Include the Agency development team: [Seyi Owolabi](mailto:seyi.owolabi@quill.com) and [Andrew Edmonds](mailto:andrew.edmonds@quill.com) plus your supervisor.
* In the subject line include terms that describe the specific issue.
* Also include terms like ___emergency___, ___urgent___ or ___time-sensitive___ to convey urgency in the subjecty line.
* In the body of the email, _as fully as possible,_ describe the issue. 
* Include as much information as you can: offer codes, module names, urls, etc.
* Include terms that convey urgency: ___emergency___, ___urgent___ or ___time-sensitive___.
* Write ___Assign to App Supt (CMS/ADCore - US.Quill)___ if the issue is about ADCore, CMS or GMP.
* Write ___Assign to Web Team (Web Dev - US.Quill)___ if the issue is about the site.

The help desk will create an incident ticket and the system will issue a receipt email. The request will move to SDS to be resolved. __Any communication with SDS about this issue should contain the request number from the receipt email issued by SDS.__

__If you do not receive a receipt email from SDS they are not working to resolve the issue you submitted.__ Check that you have sent the email to the correct address. If you have, send a follow-up email.

## If the issue is not time sensitive:
* Open [ServiceNow](https://staples.service-now.com/).
* Use you Staples employee number and hub password.
* Select ___Self Service___ from left-hand side bar.
* Select ___Service Request___ in the right-hand column.
* Select ___More...___ under ___Quill Requests___ on the right-hand side of the screen.
* Select ___Service Desk Only (Quill)___ from the ___All Quill Requests___ list.
* _As fully as possible,_ describe your issue in the ___Notes / Comments___ field.
* Include as much information as you can: offer codes, module names, urls, etc.
* Include the text: ___Assign to App Supt (CMS/ADCore - US.Quill) ___ in the ___Notes / Comments___ field if the issue is about ADCore, CMS or GMP.
* Include the text: ___Assign to Web Team (Web Dev - US.Quill)___ in the ___Notes / Comments___ field if the issue is about the site.
* Press either the ___Order Now___ or ___Add to Cart___ button (they are the same as far as I can tell).
* Click ___Submit Order___.

The system will issue a receipt email and forward your request to your supervisor for approval. Once approved, you will get another email and the request will move to SDS to be resolved. That can mean being put in the list for the next release, put at the end of the backlog or being resolved ASAP.

If you donâ€™t hear from SDS after some time, send a follow-up email, including the request number of the ticket. Also include the Agency development team: [Seyi Owolabi](mailto:seyi.owolabi@quill.com) and [Andrew Edmonds](mailto:andrew.edmonds@quill.com) plus your supervisor on the email.

You can always reach out to me or Seyi for assistance, or to troubleshoot your issue and submit the request.
