# How to request assistance from SDS
_Last updated 3/18/20_

## If the issue is time-sensitive, create an incident ticket:
* Email [USQC __IT__ (Quill) Problem Tickets](mailto:USQCITQuillProblemTickets@quill.com).
* Include the Agency development team: [Seyi Owolabi](mailto:seyi.owolabi@quill.com) and [Andy Edmonds](mailto:andrew.edmonds@quill.com) plus your supervisor.
* If the issue is related to the __push process__ also include the [USQC QUILL CONTENT PUSH](mailto:USQCQUILLCONTENTPUSH@Staples.com) team.
* In the subject line include terms that describe the specific issue.
* Also include terms like _emergency_, _urgent_ or _time-sensitive_ to convey urgency.
* In the body of the email, __as fully as possible,__ describe the issue. 
* Include as much information as you can: offer codes, module names, urls, etc.
* Also include terms that convey urgency: _emergency_, _urgent_ or _time-sensitive_.
* Write _Forward to App Supt (CMS/ADCore - US.Quill)_ if the issue is about ADCore, CMS or GMP.
* Write _Forward to Web Team (Web Dev - US.Quill)_ if the issue is about the site, preview server, push process or Akamai.

The help desk will create an incident ticket and the system will issue a receipt email. The request will move to SDS to be resolved. __Any communication with SDS about this issue should contain the request number from the receipt email issued by SDS.__

__If you do not receive a receipt email from SDS they are not working to resolve the issue you submitted.__ Check that you have sent the email to the correct address. If you have, send a follow-up email.

## If the issue is not time sensitive:
* Open [ServiceNow](https://staples.service-now.com/).
* Use you Staples employee number and hub password.
* Select _Self Service_ from left-hand side bar.
* Select _Service Request_ in the right-hand column.
* Select _More..._ under _Quill Requests_ on the right-hand side of the screen.
* Select _Service Desk Only (Quill)_ from the _All Quill Requests_ list.
* __As fully as possible,__ describe your issue in the _Notes / Comments_ field.
* Include as much information as you can: offer codes, module names, urls, etc.
* Include the text: _Forward to App Supt (CMS/ADCore - US.Quill)_ in the _Notes / Comments_ field if the issue is about the ADCore, CMS or GMP applications.
* Include the text: _Forward to Business Intelligence (BI Support - US.Quill)_ in the _Notes / Comments_ field if the issue is about CMS or ADCore data (i.e. manually pushing data to the live site that can't be handled through the GMP).
* Include the text: _Forward to Web Team (Web Dev - US.Quill)_ in the _Notes / Comments_ field if the issue is about the site.
* Press either the _Order Now_ or _Add to Cart_ button (they are the same as far as I can tell).
* Click _Submit Order_.

The system will issue a receipt email and forward your request to your supervisor for approval. Once approved, you will get another email and the request will move to SDS to be resolved. That can mean being put in the list for the next release, put at the end of the backlog or being resolved ASAP.

If you don’t hear from SDS after some time, send a follow-up email to the help desk, [USQC IT Web Support](USQCITWebSupport@Staples.com), including the request number of the ticket. Also include the Agency development team: [Seyi Owolabi](mailto:seyi.owolabi@quill.com) and [Andy Edmonds](mailto:andrew.edmonds@quill.com) plus your supervisor on the email.

You can always reach out the Agency development team for assistance, to troubleshoot your issue or submit the request.
