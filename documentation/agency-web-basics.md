# Agency Web Basics

## File servers
In the Agency we primarily use 3 file servers. The _pages_, _preview_ and _push_ servers. In most cases, final web asset should be copied to all three.

### Pages drive
`//qlnnas/pages/`

The pages drive is where all of the Agency source files are housed. There are a bunch of folders. For instance, all of the print assets are in the `Creative` folder. For our purposes we are only interested in the `WebTeam` folder which houses all of the web and email assets.

#### CAMPAIGN_RESOURCES
`//qlnnas/pages/WebTeam/CAMPAIGN_RESOURCES`

The `CAMPAIGN_RESOURCES` folder has all of the creative files for campaigns.

#### Personal_Projects
`//qlnnas/pages/WebTeam/Personal_Projects`

#### Quill
`//qlnnas/pages/WebTeam/Quill`

The `Quill` folder has.

##### Email
`//qlnnas/pages/WebTeam/Quill/Email`

The `Email` folder has all of the working files for emails.

##### WebAd
`//qlnnas/pages/WebTeam/Quill/WebAd`

The `WebAd` folder has all of the working files for web assets (i.e. web ads, graphics and landing pages).

For more information on how the `WebAd` folder file hierarchy is structured, see the [Folder Structure](https://github.com/agency-quill/agency-project-files/blob/master/documentation/folder-structure.md) documentation.

#### Resources
`//qlnnas/pages/WebTeam/Resources`




#### Archiving/restoring files
We have a limited amount of server space so we need to periodically archive our files.


Just wanted to give everyone a small update on the process for archiving/restoring old files.
 
In an effort to ensure that we are all working from the correct files, we are going use the new process below.
 
Check to ensure it is not already unarchived
Archive request to Ben & Zibi
Ben or Zibi will File moved to Unarchive Folder (File will be placed in \__UNARCHIVED_Folder)
Designer makes updates
Once complete the designer moves to Re-Archive folder (\__REARCHIVE_Folder)
There are folders by year/month, please place in the appropriate folder. These will be pushed backed into the archives to overwrite the now obsolete files.
