# Agency Web Basics

## File servers
In the Agency we primarily use 3 file servers. The pages, preview and push servers.

### Pages drive
`//qlnnas/pages/`

The pages drive is where all of the Agency source files are housed. It has the `Creative` folder which contains all of the print files and the `WebTeam` folder, which contains all of the web and email files. The `webTeam` folder holds the email and web assets that the Agency produces.

The `Quill/Email` folder has all of the working files for emails.

`//qlnnas/pages/WebTeam/Quill/Email`

The `Quill/WebAd` folder has all of the working files for web assets (i.e. graphics or landing pages).

`//qlnnas/pages/WebTeam/Quill/WebAd`

The `CAMPAIGN_RESOURCES` folder has all of the creative files for campaigns.

`//qlnnas/pages/WebTeam/CAMPAIGN_RESOURCES/`

For more information on how the file hierarchy is structured, see the [Folder Structure](https://github.com/agency-quill/agency-project-files/blob/master/documentation/folder-structure.md) documentation.
