# Agency Web Basics
_Last updated 12/12/18_

## File servers
In the Agency we primarily use 3 file servers. The __pages__, __preview__ and __push__ servers. In most cases, final web asset should be copied to all three.

### Pages drive
`//qlnnas/pages/`

The pages drive houses the majority of files generated by the Agency. For our purposes we are only interested in the `WebTeam` folder which houses all of the web and email assets.

#### CAMPAIGN_RESOURCES
`//qlnnas/pages/WebTeam/CAMPAIGN_RESOURCES`

The `CAMPAIGN_RESOURCES` folder has all of the creative files for campaigns. It is organized by year and then by campaign. Beyond that there is no established structure. The campaign can house assets, concepts and working files.

#### Personal_Projects
`//qlnnas/pages/WebTeam/Personal_Projects`

The `Personal_Projects` folder has folders for each member of the Agency. It serves as a personal workspace. It can be used to house files that don't have any other home or as a place to transfer files between Agency members. It's pretty much whatever you want it to be. Keep in mind that storage space isn't infinite, and `Personal_Projects` files are not part of our periodic archiving process. Please avoid storing large or duplicate creative files unnecessarily.

#### Quill
`//qlnnas/pages/WebTeam/Quill`

The `Quill` folder has the `Email` and `WebAd` folders. These are where the working files and final assets for email and web are stored. This folder is a remnant from a time when there were other brands. They have since been absorbed into Quill.

##### Email
`//qlnnas/pages/WebTeam/Quill/Email`

The `Email` folder has all of the working files for emails.

##### WebAd
`//qlnnas/pages/WebTeam/Quill/WebAd`

The `WebAd` folder has all of the working files for web assets (i.e. web ads, graphics and landing pages).

For more information on how the `WebAd` folder file hierarchy, see the [Folder Structure](https://github.com/agency-quill/agency-project-files/blob/master/documentation/folder-structure.md) documentation.

#### Resources
`//qlnnas/pages/WebTeam/Resources`

The `Resources` folder houses files that are used to build email and web assets. There are documents, fonts, images, scripts, styles, templates, and more. Most of the scripts and styles are moving to our [GitHub](https://github.com/agency-quill/agency-project-files) page, but there are still many useful files in the `Resources` folder.

#### Archiving and restoring files
We have a limited amount of server space so we need to periodically archive our files.

When we are bumping up against our data limit, we archive folders in the `Email` and `WebAd` folders. We archive entire months or entire years. You will know a file has been archived because the folder has the word "archived" added to it. Sometimes archiving working files doesn't remove enough and we look for other folders (i.e. `Personal_Projects`) to archive.

If you need access to an archived file, you can request for it to be restored. Restored files are found in the `__UNARCHIVED_Folder` folder in the root of the `Email` and `WebAd` folders. 
 
The file restoration/re-archiving process is:

* Check the `__UNARCHIVED_Folder` to make sure it has not already been restored
* If not, send an email to Ben &amp; Zibi asking them to restore the email or web assets you need. Be sure to send the email or web request number of job you need restored.
* The restored folder will be placed in the root of the `__UNARCHIVED_Folder` folder (e.g. `__UNARCHIVED_Folder/W14_05_374_HELP`)
* Make any updates to the files in the `__UNARCHIVED_Folder`
* If the file in question is repeatedly updated leave it in the `__UNARCHIVED_Folder` folder
* If not, re-archive the files. The `__REARCHIVE_Folder` folder is in the root of the `__UNARCHIVED_Folder` folder. To re-archive the files, move the folder from the `__UNARCHIVED_Folder` folder to the proper folder within the `__REARCHIVE_Folder` folder (e.g. `__UNARCHIVED_Folder/__REARCHIVE_Folder/2014/05/W14_05_374_HELP`)
