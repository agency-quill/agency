# Agency Web Basics

## File servers
In the Agency we primarily use 3 file servers. The pages, preview and push servers.

### Pages drive
`//qlnnas/pages/` (Mac) `\\qlnnas\pages\` (PC)

There are a lot of files in the pages drive. This is where all of the Agency source files are housed. It has the `Creative` folder which contains all of the print files and the `WebTeam` folder, which contains all of the web and email files.

The `webTeam` folder holds the main repositories for the email and web assets that the Agency produces. The `Quill/Email` folder has all of the working files for emails. The `Quill/WebAd` folder has all of the working files for web assets (i.e. graphics or landing pages). And the `CAMPAIGN_RESOURCES` folder has all of the creative files for over-arching campaigns.

`//qlnnas/pages/WebTeam/Quill/Email` (Mac) `\\qlnnas\pages\WebTeam\Quill\Email` (PC)

`//qlnnas/pages/WebTeam/Quill/WebAd` (Mac) `\\qlnnas\pages\WebTeam\Quill\WebAd` (PC)

#### Archiving/restoring files
Just wanted to give everyone a small update on the process for archiving/restoring old files.
 
In an effort to ensure that we are all working from the correct files, we are going use the new process below.
 
Check to ensure it is not already unarchived
Archive request to Ben & Zibi
Ben or Zibi will File moved to Unarchive Folder (File will be placed in \__UNARCHIVED_Folder)
Designer makes updates
Once complete the designer moves to Re-Archive folder (\__REARCHIVE_Folder)
There are folders by year/month, please place in the appropriate folder. These will be pushed backed into the archives to overwrite the now obsolete files.
