## Getting Started
What is Git? Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.(Source - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git))

#### Install Git on Mac
If you've had XCode installed (or it's Command Line Tools), Git may already be installed. To find out, open a terminal and enter git --version. [Read more...](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)

`$ git --version`

If you need to download an installation file, please do so [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

#### Install Git on Windows
Download the latest Git for [Windows installer](http://git-scm.com/download/win).Might need admin privilege to install if on Windows. Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc&t=1594s) on Windows installation.
After installation, check if git is installed.
`git --version`

## Set up

After installing Git, clone the repository following these steps. 

* On your system, create a folder anywhere (just make sure it's easy to navigate to) you want to use for your git repository.

* Navigate to the folder from the command line
`cd /path/to/folder`

* Clone the repository by typing the command below.You now have the latest file from the github repository.

`git clone https://github.com/agency-quill/agency-project-files.git`

 
## Some commands
**Note:** Any git command you run must be from the git repository (your local folder). To check where you currently are from the command line type `pwd`

_git status_ is a command you will use often to verify the current state of your repository and the files it contains.

`git status`

**Fetch and merge changes from the remote server (github) to your working directory. _Always fetch from the remote server before making any changes so you know you have the current file(s)._**
 
`git pull origin master`
 
**Add one or more files to staging**

_Add a specific file_  `git add filename`

_Add multiple files_ `git add .`

_Unstage a file_ `git reset HEAD YOUR-FILE-NAME`
 
**Commit changes to head (but not yet to the remote repository i.e. github)**

`git commit -m "commit message"`

**Send changes to the master branch of your remote repository (in this case github repo)**
 
`git push origin master`

**To trash changes in the working directory so as to allow a git pull.**

`git checkout <fileName>`

## WORKING WITH CONFLICTS

If your update is different from what is on github because someone else updated and pushed the same file you're working on, push is going to fail. Need to do a `git pull` , auto merge would fail for the conflicting files and you can resolve conflict manually by looking at the file and see what is different between your file and what was on github. Resolve conflict, commit and push as normal to github.
